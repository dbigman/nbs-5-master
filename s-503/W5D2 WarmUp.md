# Ethical Debate on Data and How We Use It

## Debate on Social Behaviour Modeling

An environmental and social agency is tracking data from private smartphones, such as GPS and accelerometer readings, surveillance cameras from CCTV systems, SmartHome devices, etc.â€”basically, it doesn't get more invasive than this.

There are two goals to this:

- **Environment Behaviour Modeling:** By studying this data and using machine learning, the agency can model which citizens have the worst impact on the environment. This data is then shared with service providers (insurance companies, utility companies, private providers like restaurants, etc.), and these citizens have their bills increased due to their poor environmental footprint.

- **Security Improvement:** By using this data, the company can predict who will be the future offenders (assaults, rapes, etc.), and therefore police departments can intervene by monitoring the potential offender, warning their neighbours, etc.
